Next Steps

Data Cleaning: Load the dataset into Tableau and Power BI, ensuring columns like dates, regions, and product categories are formatted correctly.
Field Mapping: Identify measures (e.g., revenue, profit) and dimensions (e.g., region, category).
Dashboard Creation: Use the questions as a guide to build intuitive and interactive dashboards for sales analysis.
We’ll clean and prepare this dataset for visualizations in Tableau and Power BI.

Comparison
Tableau is better for quick fixes and lightweight cleaning.
Power BI’s Power Query Editor offers more robust data transformation tools.

Cleaning Data in Tableau:

Step 1: Import the Dataset
Open Tableau and connect to your dataset (CSV or Excel file).
Drag the file into the "Data Source" workspace.

Step 2: Handle Missing Values
Open a worksheet.
Create a calculated field to replace nulls:
Click on the drop-down menu of the relevant column (e.g., State).
Select Create Calculated Field.

Use the formula:

tableau
Copy code
IFNULL([State], "Unknown")
Repeat this for other fields like Territory or PostalCode.

Step 3: Convert Dates
If OrderDate is not recognized as a date, create a calculated field:
Right-click on OrderDate > Convert to Date.
If issues persist, use the formula:
tableau

Copy code
DATE([OrderDate])

Step 4: Add Calculations
To calculate Cost, Profit, and Profit Margin:
Create a calculated field for Cost:
tableau

Copy code
[Sales] * 0.7
Create a calculated field for Profit:
tableau

Copy code
[Sales] - [Cost]
Create a calculated field for Profit Margin:
tableau

Copy code
([Profit] / [Sales]) * 100

Step 5: Save and Build Visualizations
Use these clean fields in your dashboards for visualization.

Change the Data Type to "Date" in the toolbar.

Step 5: Add Custom Columns
Click Add Column > Custom Column.
Create new columns for calculations:

Cost:

Copy code
[Sales] * 0.7
